# muzplay

## TODO

This is just what I think I must do to make my own music player for PC...
And yea I will use Python, cuz why not. That is my own music player. I am just having fun.

Pre-UI stuff:

- [x] Actually play music file (pause/resume is here too)
- [ ] Play multiple files in alphabetical order
- [x] Skip song or go to previous
- [ ] Get time where you left the song
- [ ] Replay from where you stopped
- [ ] Music time position ??? (Probably bad English) :P
- [ ] Total playtime of all files

Middle stuff (Dunno how to name this):

- [ ] Get files/folder to play

UI stuff:

- [ ] Display all files that are going to be played (not at the same time of course)
- [ ] Display progress bar (well playtime of the song) :)
- [ ] Display cool bars going up and down (Feature?)
- [ ] Display sound wave (Feature?)
- [ ] Buttons ðŸ¤”

Will probably add some stuff to that list soon. (^_^)
